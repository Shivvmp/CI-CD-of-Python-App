## Setting Up Your CI/CD Pipeline

This guide walks you through establishing a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for  Python application using GitHub, AWS CodePipeline, and AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodeDeploy

**Prerequisites**

* An AWS account
* A GitHub account

**1. Create a GitHub Repository**

- If you don't already have one, establish a new repository on GitHub to store your application's source code.
- Provide a descriptive name, choose the appropriate visibility setting, and initialize the repository with a README.

**2. Build Your CI/CD Pipeline with AWS CodePipeline**

1. **Navigate to AWS CodePipeline:** Log in to the AWS Management Console and locate the CodePipeline service.
2. **Create a New Pipeline:** Click the "Create pipeline" button.
3. **Define Pipeline Stages:**
   - **Source Stage:**
     - Select "GitHub" as the source provider.
     - Connect your GitHub account and choose the repository containing your Python code.
     - Specify the branch you want to use for CI/CD triggers.
   - **Build Stage:**
     - Select "AWS CodeBuild" as the build provider.
     - Create a new CodeBuild project by clicking "Create project."
     - Configure the CodeBuild project for your Python application, including:
       - Build environment (OS, runtime, resources)
       - Build commands (dependency installation, testing)
       - Artifacts (build output for deployment)
   - **Optional Deployment Stage (CD):**
     - Configure deployment to your preferred target (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, EC2 instance).

**3. Configure AWS CodeBuild**

1. **Create a Build Project:** Navigate to the AWS CodeBuild service and click "Create build project."
2. **Project Details:**
   - Assign a name to your build project.
   - Select "AWS CodePipeline" as the source provider.
   - Choose the CodePipeline you created earlier.
3. **Build Environment:**
   - Specify the operating system, runtime environment, and compute resources required for building your Python application.

**4. Build Commands and Artifacts**

- Define the commands for:
   - Installing dependencies (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
   - Running tests (e.g., `pytest`)
- Configure CodeBuild to generate the necessary build output (artifacts) for deployment.

**5. Review and Create**

- Carefully review the settings in your CodeBuild project for accuracy.
- Click "Create build project" to bring your CodeBuild project to life.

**6. Triggering the CI Process**

- Make a change to your Python application's code in your GitHub repository.
- Commit and push the changes to the branch you configured in CodePipeline.
- The CodePipeline should automatically initiate the CI process upon detecting changes.
- CodePipeline will fetch the latest code, execute the build process with CodeBuild, and (if configured) deploy the application.

**7. Triggering the CD Process (Deploy to EC2)**

**Option 1: Manual Deployment**

- After successful CI execution, you can manually deploy the application to your EC2 instance using tools like AWS CLI, CloudFormation templates, or custom scripts.

**Option 2: Automated Deployment with AWS CodeDeploy**

1. **Create an AWS CodeDeploy Application and Deployment Group:**
   - Configure CodeDeploy to target your EC2 instance(s) for deployment.
2. **Integrate CodeDeploy with CodePipeline:**
   - Modify your CodePipeline stages to trigger CodeDeploy upon successful completion of the build stage.

**Additional Considerations:**

- For advanced CI/CD workflows, explore tools like AWS CodeCommit (private Git repository), unit test frameworks, code coverage analysis, and security scanning during the build stage.
- Customize commands and configurations based on your specific Python application and deployment environment.
- Regularly review and update your CI/CD pipeline to align with evolving application requirements.
